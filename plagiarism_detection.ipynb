The project utilizes both traditional TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and advanced SBERT (Sentence-BERT) models to identify potential plagiarism between a suspect document and a corpus of documents. A web-based graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed using the Gradio library to facilitate easy interaction with the tool.\n",

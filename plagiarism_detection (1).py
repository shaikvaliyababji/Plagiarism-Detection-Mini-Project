"""# Plagiarism Detection Mini-Project Documentation

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed overview of the plagiarism detection mini-project, implemented in Python. The project utilizes both traditional TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and advanced SBERT (Sentence-BERT) models to identify potential plagiarism between a suspect document and a corpus of documents. A web-based graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed using the Gradio library to facilitate easy interaction with the tool.

**Screenshot Suggestion:** Include a screenshot of the final Gradio GUI running in your Colab notebook.

## 2. Setup and Installation

This section outlines the necessary steps to set up and run the project in a Google Colab environment.

### 2.1 Prerequisites

*   Google Account to access Google Colab.

### 2.2 Installing Libraries

The project requires the following Python libraries:

*   `nltk`: For natural language processing tasks like tokenization and stop word removal.
*   `scikit-learn`: For implementing the TF-IDF model and cosine similarity.
*   `sentence-transformers`: For implementing the SBERT model.
*   `gradio`: For building the web-based GUI.

These libraries can be installed using `pip` in a code cell within your Colab notebook.

**Screenshot Suggestion:** Include a screenshot of the code cell used to install the required libraries (`%pip install ...`) and the successful installation output.

## 3. Code Explanation

This section explains the core components of the Python code used for plagiarism detection.

### 3.1 Importing Libraries and Helper Functions

This part of the code imports all necessary libraries and defines helper functions, such as text preprocessing for TF-IDF.

**Screenshot Suggestion:** Include a screenshot of the cell containing all the import statements and helper functions.

### 3.2 TF-IDF Model

Explain how the TF-IDF model is used to represent documents as vectors and how cosine similarity is calculated to find similarities between the suspect document and corpus documents.

### 3.3 SBERT Model

Explain how the SBERT model is used to generate sentence embeddings and how cosine similarity is applied to measure the semantic similarity between documents.

### 3.4 `check_plagiarism` Function

Detail the `check_plagiarism` function, which takes the suspect document and corpus documents as input, applies both TF-IDF and SBERT models, and returns the similarity results.

**Screenshot Suggestion:** Include a screenshot of the `check_plagiarism` function code.

### 3.5 `run_plagiarism_check` Function

Explain the `run_plagiarism_check` function, which acts as an intermediary between the Gradio GUI and the `check_plagiarism` function. It handles input formatting from the GUI and output formatting for the GUI.

**Screenshot Suggestion:** Include a screenshot of the `run_plagiarism_check` function code.

## 4. GUI Implementation with Gradio

This section describes how the Gradio library was used to create the interactive GUI.

### 4.1 Designing the Interface Layout

Explain how the `gradio.Interface` class was used to define the layout of the GUI, including the input textboxes for the suspect document and corpus documents, and the output textboxes for the TF-IDF and SBERT results.

**Screenshot Suggestion:** Include a screenshot of the code defining the Gradio interface layout.

### 4.2 Launching the GUI

Show the code used to launch the Gradio interface, making it accessible via a local or public URL.

**Screenshot Suggestion:** Include a screenshot of the code cell used to launch the Gradio interface and the output showing the public URL.

## 5. Testing

Describe the testing process used to verify the functionality of the plagiarism detection tool and the GUI.

### 5.1 Test Cases

Outline the different test cases used, such as:

*   Checking an original document against the corpus.
*   Checking a direct copy of a corpus document.
*   Checking a paraphrased version of a corpus document.

**Screenshot Suggestion:** For each test case, include a screenshot of the Gradio GUI with the input provided and the corresponding output results (TF-IDF and SBERT scores).

## 6. Conclusion and Future Improvements

Summarize the key findings of the project and discuss potential areas for future improvement, such as:

*   Adding support for different input formats (file uploads).
*   Implementing progress indicators for long processing times.
*   Exploring other plagiarism detection techniques.
*   Improving the user interface and user experience.

## 7. Appendices (Optional)

Include any additional relevant information, such as data sources or references.

## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   The Gradio library was successfully installed and utilized to build a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) for the plagiarism detection tool.
*   The GUI layout was designed with separate input fields for the suspect document and corpus documents, and output fields for TF-IDF and SBERT results.
*   The plagiarism detection logic, including both TF-IDF and SBERT models, was successfully integrated into a function (`run\_plagiarism\_check`) called by the GUI.
*   The GUI application was successfully launched and tested, demonstrating its ability to calculate and display similarity scores for different input scenarios, including original text, direct copies, and paraphrased content.
*   The GUI was refined by adding clearer labels, placeholder text, descriptions, and increasing the size of the input textboxes for improved user experience.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   Consider adding more sophisticated input handling for corpus documents, allowing users to upload files or specify a directory instead of pasting text into a textbox.
*   Implement progress indicators or feedback mechanisms in the GUI to inform the user that the plagiarism check is running, especially for larger inputs which may take time to process.
